I need a 3D model of a beer mug. It must have at least 800 polygons.
Write coordinates of verteces and vertex definitions of polygons in the following format:
verts = [(-1.0, -1.0, 0.0), (1.0, -1.0, 0.0), (-1.0, 1.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0, 0.0), ...]
faces = [[0, 1, 3, 2], ... ]
Where verts is a python list of tuples of x, y, z coordinates in 3D space and faces is a list of indeces for the verts list.

Create a 3D model of a beer mug that has at least 500 polygons and 2000 verteces.
Write coordinates of verteces and vertex definitions of polygons in the following format:
verts = [(-1.001, -1.043, 0.031), (1.123, -1.441, 0.124), (-1.124, 1.655, 1.331), (1.433, 1.1, 0.009), ...]
faces = [[0, 1, 3, 2], ... ]
where verts is a python list of tuples of x, y, z coordinates in 3D space and faces is a list of indeces for the verts list. Write only the coordinates and face definitions and nothing else. Create as many verteces and as many polygons as possible. Model as many parts of an object as possible.
